# Security Guide for LLM Art Web

## ‚úÖ Security Fixes Applied

### 1. **Security Headers Added**

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Comprehensive CSP policy with script, style, and connect-src restrictions
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - HTTPS enforcement (production only, max-age=31536000)

### 2. **Information Disclosure Prevention**

- Removed sensitive data from console logs
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage
- Protected message content from appearing in logs
- Generic error responses to prevent information enumeration
- Secure logging practices with minimal exposure

### 3. **WebSocket Security Enhancements**

- Rate limiting (10 connections per IP per minute) with automatic cleanup
- Origin validation in production environment
- Connection cleanup and resource management
- IP-based connection tracking with time-window reset
- Client IP detection from headers (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip)
- Proper connection state management and cleanup

### 4. **Environment Variable Validation**

- JWT_SECRET minimum length requirement (32+ characters) with regex validation
- ALLOWED_DEVICE_ID format validation (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)
- Startup validation with clear error messages and application termination
- Environment-based configuration with secure defaults

### 5. **Authentication & Authorization Enhancements**

- JWT-based authentication with device-specific validation
- Secure token verification with proper error handling
- Device ID validation against allowed list
- Authentication state management per connection
- Proper connection termination on authentication failures

## üî¥ Critical Security Recommendations

### 1. **Production Deployment Security**

#### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set securely in production:

```bash
# Generate a strong JWT secret (at least 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET="your-very-long-secure-random-string-here-32-chars-minimum"

# Set your allowed device ID
ALLOWED_DEVICE_ID="your-secure-device-identifier"

# Set production environment
NODE_ENV="production"

# Optional: Custom port
PORT="3000"
```

#### HTTPS Configuration

- **Always use HTTPS in production**
- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare) for SSL termination
- Enable HTTP/2 for better performance

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**

#### Current Implementation

- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication for message sending with device validation
- ‚úÖ Device-based authorization with allowed device ID list
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Zod schemas for all message types
- ‚úÖ Authentication state tracking per WebSocket connection
- ‚úÖ Secure connection termination on authentication failures

#### Additional Recommendations

- Consider implementing JWT refresh tokens for longer sessions
- Add JWT expiration validation and automatic token refresh
- Implement session management for multiple devices
- Consider adding user roles or permissions for fine-grained access control
- Implement audit logging for authentication events

### 3. **Network Security**

#### Firewall Rules

- Only expose necessary ports (80, 443)
- Block direct access to application port if using reverse proxy
- Implement fail2ban or similar for brute force protection

#### Rate Limiting (Already Implemented)

- 10 connections per IP per minute with time-window reset
- Automatic cleanup of old connection data (2x rate limit window)
- IP-based tracking with proper header detection
- Connection count decrementing on disconnect
- Consider reducing limits in high-traffic scenarios
- Returns 429 status code for rate limit violations

### 4. **Monitoring & Logging**

#### Security Logging

```javascript
// Current logging (minimal for security):
- WebSocket connection events (no sensitive data)
- Authentication status (success/failure without tokens)
- Rate limiting violations
- Conversation history size management

// Add to your monitoring system:
- Failed authentication attempts with IP tracking
- Rate limit violations with client identification
- Suspicious connection patterns and frequency
- Error rates and types without sensitive data
- Origin validation failures in production
```

#### Recommended Tools

- Use structured logging (e.g., Winston, Pino)
- Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Set up uptime monitoring

### 5. **Data Protection**

#### Current Status

- ‚úÖ No sensitive data stored long-term
- ‚úÖ Message history limited (1000 messages) and automatically cleaned up (at 1200)
- ‚úÖ No user personal data collection
- ‚úÖ Conversation history cleared on restart signals
- ‚úÖ In-memory storage only, no persistent data
- ‚úÖ Timestamps added for message tracking but no user identification

#### Additional Considerations

- Consider encrypting conversation history at rest (if persistence is added)
- Implement data retention policies with configurable limits
- Add GDPR compliance if serving EU users or storing personal data
- Consider adding conversation export/import functionality with encryption
- Implement secure session management if user accounts are added

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist for Production

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Strong JWT_SECRET (32+ characters) configured and validated
- [ ] ALLOWED_DEVICE_ID properly set with format validation
- [ ] NODE_ENV=production configured (enables HSTS and origin validation)
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL certificates installed and configured
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured (nginx/Apache) with proper headers
- [ ] Firewall rules implemented with minimal port exposure
- [ ] Rate limiting configuration tested (10 connections/IP/minute)
- [ ] Origin validation configured for production environment

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Security headers verified (use securityheaders.com) - all 6 headers present
- [ ] SSL configuration tested (use ssllabs.com) with A+ rating
