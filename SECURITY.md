# Security Guide for LLM Art Web

## ‚úÖ Security Fixes Applied

### 1. **Security Headers Added**
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Comprehensive CSP policy
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - HTTPS enforcement (production only)

### 2. **Information Disclosure Prevention**
- Removed sensitive data from console logs
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage
- Protected message content from appearing in logs

### 3. **WebSocket Security Enhancements**
- Added rate limiting (10 connections per IP per minute)
- Implemented origin validation in production
- Connection cleanup and resource management
- IP-based connection tracking

### 4. **Environment Variable Validation**
- JWT_SECRET minimum length requirement (32+ characters)
- ALLOWED_DEVICE_ID format validation
- Startup validation with clear error messages

## üî¥ Critical Security Recommendations

### 1. **Production Deployment Security**

#### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set securely in production:

```bash
# Generate a strong JWT secret (at least 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET="your-very-long-secure-random-string-here-32-chars-minimum"

# Set your allowed device ID
ALLOWED_DEVICE_ID="your-secure-device-identifier"

# Set production environment
NODE_ENV="production"

# Optional: Custom port
PORT="3000"
```

#### HTTPS Configuration
- **Always use HTTPS in production**
- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare) for SSL termination
- Enable HTTP/2 for better performance

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**

#### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication for message sending
- ‚úÖ Device-based authorization
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Zod schemas

#### Additional Recommendations
- Consider implementing JWT refresh tokens for longer sessions
- Add JWT expiration validation
- Implement session management for multiple devices

### 3. **Network Security**

#### Firewall Rules
- Only expose necessary ports (80, 443)
- Block direct access to application port if using reverse proxy
- Implement fail2ban or similar for brute force protection

#### Rate Limiting (Already Implemented)
- 10 connections per IP per minute
- Automatic cleanup of old connection data
- Consider reducing limits in high-traffic scenarios

### 4. **Monitoring & Logging**

#### Security Logging
```javascript
// Add to your monitoring system:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious connection patterns
- Error rates and types
```

#### Recommended Tools
- Use structured logging (e.g., Winston, Pino)
- Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Set up uptime monitoring

### 5. **Data Protection**

#### Current Status
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data stored long-term
- ‚úÖ Message history limited and cleaned up
- ‚úÖ No user personal data collection

#### Additional Considerations
- Consider encrypting conversation history at rest
- Implement data retention policies
- Add GDPR compliance if serving EU users

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist for Production

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Strong JWT_SECRET (32+ characters) configured
- [ ] ALLOWED_DEVICE_ID properly set
- [ ] NODE_ENV=production configured
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL certificates installed
- [ ] Reverse proxy configured (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Firewall rules implemented

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Security headers verified (use securityheaders.com)
- [ ] SSL configuration tested (use ssllabs.com)
- [ ] Rate limiting tested and working
- [ ] Error pages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular dependency updates (`bun update`)
- [ ] Security audit with `bun audit`
- [ ] Log review for suspicious activity
- [ ] Performance monitoring for DoS attacks
- [ ] Regular SSL certificate renewal

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Breach

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate JWT_SECRET immediately
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Review recent logs for anomalies

2. **Investigation**
   - Check access logs for unauthorized access
   - Review WebSocket connection patterns
   - Examine error logs for attack attempts

3. **Recovery**
   - Clear conversation history if compromised
   - Update security configurations
   - Notify users if necessary

## üìû Security Contacts

- Keep this documentation updated
- Establish incident response procedures
- Consider security consulting for high-value deployments

## üîÑ Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets
- [ ] Update dependencies
